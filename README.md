# SelfLove
Mental health awareness 

Forgive yourself.

Whatever past you came from, 
you don’t have to keep going back. 
Your history can’t be changed, 
but you can work on starting over.

And that’s where your power lies - 
in the present.
exchange your shame & anger,
 with self-love & self-compassion
 ❤️‍🩹
You will never regret making 
self care and self love your 
top priority.
